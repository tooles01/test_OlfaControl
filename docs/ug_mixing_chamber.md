## Hardware

### Changes from v1 to v2:

#### Clippard 8-MC heart:
- Odor input hole (from the bottom) was previously not aligned with its connecting inlet hole (horizontal) - tied geometries together  
	- (x_Clippard 8-MC heart v50 v3 shows the initial error)  
	- (Clippard 8-MC heart_v01 has some fixed things in it)  
- Odor (vial) inlet ID changed from .046" to .03125" (1/32") (to match 1/32" ID tubing)  


#### Clippard 8-MC cover:
- PCB mounting holes: just picked a dimension since it seems last time it was made up
